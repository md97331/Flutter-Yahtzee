# Yahtzee

## Overview
I've developed a single-player Yahtzee Dice Game App, an exciting project where players roll five dice up to three times per turn to achieve various scoring combinations. The aim is to accumulate the highest score possible by making strategic choices about which combinations to pursue.

## Features
* Rolling Mechanism: Players can roll the dice up to three times per turn. This core mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the game, as players must decide when to re-roll and when to hold their dice.

* Dice Holding Functionality: After each roll, players have the option to "hold" any of the dice. Held dice are not re-rolled, allowing players to build towards specific combinations.

* Scoring Categories: The game features 13 different scoring categories. Players choose a category at the end of each turn to register their score, based on the dice outcome.

* Score Calculation: The app calculates scores for each category and updates the total score. This automated scoring system allows players to focus on the gameplay.

* Game Completion and Reset: Once all categories have been used, the game ends, displaying the final score. Players can then reset the game to start a new round.

## User Experience
Creating the Yahtzee Dice Game App was a complex task that involved implementing various stateful widgets and state-management techniques. The challenge was to create an engaging, interactive game that faithfully recreates the Yahtzee experience in a digital format.

I paid particular attention to the user interface, ensuring that the dice rolling, holding functionality, and score selection were intuitive and visually appealing. The design was laid out to fit within a 720p resolution, making the game suitable for both mobile and desktop platforms.
